Using this language: 'es'  and this unit system: 'metric' . Create a 7-day meal plan in PURE JSON format with:
- daily_calorie_target (number)
- macro_ratios (object with protein, carbs, fat)
- unit_system (metric, imperial, US customary, etc.) 
- an object with the explanation of the unit used:
  "units": {
    "macro": {
      "protein": "g",
      "carbs": "g",
      "fat": "g",
      "energy":"kcal"
    },
    "portion": "g"
  }
- weekly_plan (array of days with three meals and two snacks per day, where each array of meals belongs to each day), something like this:
   "weekly_plan": [
        {
            "day": "Monday",
            "meals": [
                {
                    "meal": "Breakfast",
                    "food": "Oatmeal with fruits and nuts",
                    "portion": 300,
                    "macro": {
                        "protein": 20,

                        "fat": 10,
                        "energy":400
                    }
                },
                {
                    "meal": "Lunch",
                ...
                },
                ....
            ]
        },
        {
            "day": "Tuesday",
            "meals": [
                ...
            ]
        },
        ...
    ]
